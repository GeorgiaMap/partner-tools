# Partner Tool Add-Ons

These are “Nice to Have” addons that we'd like to include in the Destination Partner Tools.

### 4.1.	Destination Deals
4.1.1.	Use of the Deal section by our destination partners has declined as more popular Deal sites have emerged (GroupOn, etc). Will your solution allow for custom deal posting. Y/N 
4.1.2.	Can your solution pull and merge deals from multiple third-party sources?
4.1.3.	Can your solution filter Deals by regions of the state?

### 4.2.	 Personal Travel Emails
4.2.1.	Can the Offerors solution or an integrated third-party tool provide unique emails for every recipient based on combinations of their interests? Y/N
4.2.1.1.	If yes, can custom emails be sent automatically daily based on travel date ranges and locations saved by users. Y/N

See [WP Travel Engine](https://wptravelengine.com/downloads/advanced-itinerary-builder/)  

### 4.3.	 Deep Search across both CMS and Listing Database
Provide search results that include both page content from the CMS and partner admin database content (locations, events). Implement using techniques that avoid impacting page performance. Include filters that populate URL # hash values to share search results.

### 4.4.	 Embedded Requests
Include a "Suggest Changes" link on listing pages and in lists (3-dot menu), to reduce calls. Display a list of suggested changes on the front-end when viewing as an administrator. Allow staff to manage change lists with Bootcamp integration. Allow staff to activate some requests as “known issues” so people see the issue when they start to make a similar request.

### 4.5.	 Knowledgebase with Chatbot
Implementation of a knowledgebase response service tied to site API, including event data, so chatbot can respond to questions in both chat and during site searches, include the intro to a Contact Us process. Answers provided by our staff and volunteers should be stored for future bot responses.

### 4.6.	 Event Aggregator
Events are a popular area of our website, but partners are not maintaining event listings at the level needed. Solutions can use API pulls to aggregate events and location data from different sources (FB, Eventbrite, etc.), with the opportunity to review events for some partners prior to display. Event pulls for approved partners could be displayed live without approval.

- Pull events from state park website - so every region of the state has content
- Share art events with GaArts.org


### 4.7.	 Google Places for Fresh Images and Hours of Operation
Google places could augment Hours of Operation and provide physical address, phone numbers and reusable images from Google Places Photos. Partners could check which images to reuse. The option to ignore Google would be needed to deactivate pulls for specific listings.

### 4.8.	 Emergency Lodging List
In the past we’ve displayed a lodging map during hurricanes using a Google Sheet for real-time updates by our Convention and Visitor Bureau (CVB) staff. Expedia and TripAdvisor also provide options for emergency lodging availability with a Pro license.
4.8.1.	Could Offeror solution provide a process for listing lodging availability and emergency shelters during hurricanes or other crises? Y/N
4.8.2.	If yes, describe how your solution could be used to manage and display availability during disasters.
